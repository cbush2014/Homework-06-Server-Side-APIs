List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. 
* Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.
* Use dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
* Icon image and card background image changes dynamically as a visual representation of weather conditions


To-do list:
* Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions.
* Include a search history so that users can access their past search terms
